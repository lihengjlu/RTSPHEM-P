## Introduce

**RTSPHEM-P** — **The model framework couples RTSPHEM and PHREEQC by using a sequential non-iterative approach. The introduction of RTSPHEM model framework can be referred to the study of Stephan Gärttner and Florian Frank (https://github.com/cupperfreeze/RTSPHEM/).

## How to use
First, make sure you have IPhreeqc (https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/software/PHREEQC/IPhreeqcCOM-3.7.3-15968-x64.msi) installed on your computer. Then download and extract the code file, run Matlab, and add all folders and subfolders to your working path.
The script file is in the "MainProgram" file. The post-processing tool mainly uses ParaView.
